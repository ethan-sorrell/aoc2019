- each number composed of single digits
- perform dot-product with a repeating pattern vector
- keep only the 1s digits of the result (least significant digit)

- pattern:
  - base pattern is 0 1 0 -1
  - repeat each value in base pattern number of times equal to position in output list
  - e.g 0 0 1 1 0 0 -1 -1
  - then apply offset list left by one (remove first element)
  - e.g. 0 1 1 0 0 -1 -1
